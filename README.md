# Sparta-Global-TapDefense
This project aim was to get more familiar with using Javascript, HTML5 and CSS by creating a game with them without using canvas.
## Instructions
The player will have to click on the monsters to defeat them before they reach the wall at the bottom of the game.
The player has 3 lives and the game is played till the player fails. The aim of the game is to see how far the player can reach and this is tracked by a score which is at the bottom of the screen
The monster  movement speed was designed for a laptop track pad which means using a mouse will most likely be easier.

## Built with:
* Javascript
* css
* HTML5

## Future features
* Different enemies for example (enemies that require more than one click to be destroy, different movement patterns and abilities).
* Bosses on certain kill counts for example when player reaches 50 kills a boss will spawned.
* A shop to buy upgrades or abilities for example (buying a abilities that make 1 click worth 2 clicks to kill enemies that require 2 click to be killed faster).
* Score board with persistence data.
* Make all variables local instead of having global ones.
* Better sprites for example (same style and more variety).
* change the game to be  play horizontal instead of vertically. This will allow for more space and access to more sprites as most of them were from the side not front on which was required for the game layout.
