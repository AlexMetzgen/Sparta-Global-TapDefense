##Instructions
The player will have to click on the monsters to defeat them before they reach the wall at the bottom of the game.
The player has 3 lives and the game is played till the player fails. The aim of the game is to see how far the player can reach and this is tracked by a score which is at the bottom of the screen
The monster  movement speed was designed for a laptop track pad which means using a mouse will most likely be easier.
